About these Ubuntu Mono console PSF fonts:

These are early bitmap snapshots of the Ubuntu Mono fonts built
with a very limited charater set.  Please feel free to experiment
and give feedback to improve the state of the hinting:

Warning about the italics (RI, BI):

A note that italics will *not* work on the console very well.  This is
because the diagonal slant of the characters takes the glyphs beyond
the edges of the cell.  When being rendered for console use these end
up being cropped at the edges.  For the moment the italics are only
included for completeness.

Good luck, and happy experimenting.  For more details, see the:

  debian/console/

directory in the package source code.
